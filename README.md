# MSCKF Tutorial

## Introduction
This project contains a basic Multi-Constraint Kalman Filter(MSCKF) implementation to solve the
visual inertial odometry(VIO) problem. The MSCKF is an extended kalman filter first introduced in
X, and is the main way to solve VIO within the EKF framework.

This project should serve as a tutorial. Hopefully, people can read through the codebase
and learn how an MSCKF works. It is a fairly basic implementation, and lacks some of the more modern upgrades such as
the observability constraints. Plus as it is implemented in Python it lacks the speed necessary to run
this on a actual system. If you do want a useful ,performant MSCKF solution then I recommend
the OpenVINS[X] project.
